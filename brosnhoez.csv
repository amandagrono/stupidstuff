688,"The fact that her milkshake brings all the boys to the yard does NOT mean it's better than mine.

In the song titled ""Milkshake"" by Kelis, she exclaims how all the boys show up in her yard for milkshakes which claim to be better than mine. Not only is this self entitlement, but she doesn't give any valid reasons as to why her milkshakes are better. According to the lyrics of this boastful chant, she is willing to offer lessons for making such a milkshake but for a price. Could that mean that the ingredients used to make this milkshake cost more than the labelled price and instead of increasing it to maintain profit, she gives lessons on how to make such a milkshake in order to compensate for her lack of total earnings? Is she that desperate to keep the ALL the boys in her yard!? A low price in exchange for a higher consumer rate, and yet she claims that her milkshakes are better than mine. What if she were to increase the prices, will all the boys still head to the yard cause the milkshake is THAT good?? She even says that her milkshake making techniques ""drive the guys crazy"" and ""freak these boys"". It's unbelievable how one's milkshakes can be judged simply by how it's prepared. I highly believe that my milkshakes are capable of bringing all the people to the yard with hard work and reasonable prices. I'm assured that one day, I will be capable of creating ultimate milkshake which brings not only boys, but also girls to my yard. Let not one sex judge and conclude without having to hear from the other. And from there, it will bring equality and fairness into this competition of milkshakes. With that, I conclude that her milkshakes are not better than mine just because it brings all the boys to the yard."

948,I just realized if u select no credit for al classes but one and get an A your GPA will be a 4.0 for that semester
949,yessir that’s my plan
950,Just make sure u have a reason to explain to possible employers why u did that 
951,Yes but your grade would go up only by 3/(however many total credits you take) so it won’t bump up your cumulative GPA as much :((
952,Yea ur cumulative wouldn’t move like at all 
953,It only makes sense if ur a freshman and do like 2 or 3 harder classes as NC and get A+ in ur gen Ed’s 
954,i think i might just switch to pass/fail for my micro class bc i’m not feeling it and all of my other classes i deadass have a 100
955,I might switch for my operating systems class
956,plus i’m switching out of fox so i wouldn’t have to jump through the hoops to make sure my micro grade was sufficient anyway

964,It should count for pre req just not towards GPA
965,but be careful if u wanna do grad school or something cuz they might ask question. Just do research on ur grad school if ur doing that

980,not that i’m super religious anymore but like #catholicschool

1961,I never thought of it as eating a lot but thats sick

2748,So are they going to?
2749,"nah, the director at the time was fired for being unreliable and disney thought that the “star wars stories” weren’t going to well after Solo tanked "
2750,"but, in the replacement of a boba fett movie, we got The Mandalorian "

2775,What do you mean excel fails??
2776,"Well I clicked a cell then it just stopped working. Couldn’t scroll type edit do anything. Had to close down from task manager, reopened my excel and boom all the formulas were gone so I had to guess on 5/13 of the questions cause I had 13 minutes and failed it"
2777,Ohhhhh shit that sucks
2778,did you email your teacher?? 
2779,yeah do you think they will allow you to retake it maybe if you tell them what happened
2780,Idk what an email would do. Even if they do let me retake it I barely knew the last chapter which was 4/13 questions cause I couldn’t wake up for class
2781,Just try 
2782,It won’t hurt 
2783,Yea I’m going to I just dunno what to say LOL

2804,RSM just cancelled my internship
2805,Oh no :(
2806,"They're doing a ""12-day virtual experience"" and paying us $2,500, and giving us full time offers with a $2,000 signing bonus "
2807,Well that’s pretty good actually 
2808,Can you take the offer and have a job upon graduation?
2809,Emphasized “Well that’s pretty good actually ”
2810,"Still fucking sucks. I was so to be making $10,000 from it overall, I'm not getting any experience, and I'm not getting any ""points"" for my major "
2811,"Yeah, I can accept it now "
2812,Wait what?? How can that not be points for your major 
2813,"But I don't think want to work for them, I want to work for Grant Thornton "
2814,The points were for a full time 8 week internship program 
2815,I feel like Fox has to be more lenient with that because of the situation 
2816,"Like a lot companies are laying a lot of people with actual full time jobs off, and even more just aren’t having any internships whatsoever "
2817,Emphasized “I feel like Fox has to be more lenient with that because of the situation ”
2818,"Also, would you be able to accept the offer with RSM, and then apply to Grant Thornton to see if you get that job? And if you do you can always give back the signing bonus or something"
2819,"Private companies can’t hold you hostage, but I’m pretty sure you’d be required to give back the signing bonus "
2820,"Unfortunately Fox is, because that’s what I run. This is the MIS major, which is gonna catch hell from me and the dean’s office if they don’t ease up. Usually its wrong to accept with knowing you might deny later, but I was just talking to my boss on a meeting rn and he was like “they just cancelled on you, so why not cancel on them.”"
2821,So that’s probably what I’ll do.
2822,fuck dude im sorry
2823,the world sucks rn it feels like its gradually getting worse
2824,but we’re in it together ❤️
2825,Idk if you’re interested but i just wanted to throw it out there. If your paid internship is rescinded you should have a valid unemployment claim 
2826,really???
2827,and you could most likely make up to wht it would have been to work with rsm
2828,Yeah and bc of covid if you have a valid claim trump made it so you can make an extra 600 a week on top of that claim
2829,bro im boutta do that with my internship bc its been making me feel like poop that I lost it 
2830,BOTH of mine
2831,"I'm still employed by Temple and working for them, so I can't "
2832,My friend is getting 860 a week for sitting at home lmao 
2833,That's such bullshit. I'm working and not getting that much
2834,Exactly LOL
2835,well the pay is higher here but still
2836,Fuck America. There should never be an incentive NOT too work
2837,He isn’t a dependent so he’s getting stimulus plus unemployment 
2838,Yeah its a big issue i think bc people arent going back to work bc they are making way more than they would have
2839,Emphasized “Yeah its a big issue i think bc people arent going back to work bc they are making way more than they would have”
2840,Yea his boss actually called him and was like yo u wanna work more and he went nope. And the boss understood why and was like kk 
2841,my summer job is working on an ice cream truck (technically essential) and because the guy who owns it is REALLY tryna wife my mom he’s paying me $15/hr and letting me keep all my tips and i just think it’s funny
2842,Yeah this is probably only going to last until july tho so that’s risky bc come july unless trump makes an extension a lot of people who refused to go back to work are guna be SOL
2843,The west coast states extended the stay at homes indefinitely 🤪
2844,Shit we open up on may 15th lmao
2845,But itll probably be extended
2846,"I mean I understand why a lot of people don’t want to go to work, cause a lot of people still feel like everything is prematurely opening"
2847,Not those white people with guns storming the governors office 😂

2849,Emphasized “Not those white people with guns storming the governors office 😂”
2850,Have any of yall ever taken summer class from a college outside of temple? 
2851,yes 
2852,"What school did you go through? Temple is basically telling me if we offer it, you can’t take it anywhere else "
2853,wtf 
2854,i went through the community college by my house

2860,"Wait wait wait, Julia can you talk to me about what you said earlier today. About getting paid for being out of work? Because I just found out my summer isn’t going to be spent sitting behind the desk of an investment bank"
2861,"So if you got fired/laid off/internship rescinded etc. and are not currently employed, you should have a valid unemployment claim. If your unemployment claim is passed then under trumps covid 19 response you would get an extra $600 a week on top of the unemployment pay through july unless he extends it. It varies from state to state though. But you file for unemployment in the state where you were or were going to be working. For PA i think you must be able to provide proof of a job/internship offer in order to receive unemployment but dont quote me on that."
2862,Jk not fired but laid off
2863,All the info is on the states unemployment website
2864,"Will certainly be looking into that, thank you very much for all the information!"
2865,Ofc!

3367,"Well unfortunately the way most of the US works, if you work in a “tippable” industry, they employer is no longer required to pay you minimum wage. Cause of this workers are now forced to provide 100% service just to earn their tips. Annndddd that leads to sexual assault (just cuz my moms had cases) and other shit "
3368,Oh yeah I know that’s how it works around here
3369,"There was a case I think it was in Cali, where a car repair shop owner literally put a plastic tip jar out and then refused to pay his employees"
3370,The tip wage thing is a very specific type of tipping tho 
3371,"I’m pretty sure a tip jar shouldn’t count according to that, like each individual person is tipped or whatever "
3372,Plus if they don’t make at least min. Wage they need to pay the difference I believe
3373,It didn’t count because they had previously had salaries but technically a tip jar counts

3576,So Phillys Governor Wolf closed all the jobs and shut down the city for all jobs except essentials... but he is a huge owner in his family business Wolf Cabinets which is in York PA which didn’t close because it was considered essential... isn’t that insane
3577,Like LOL Im gonna fuck over everyone but my family business is still going to be running
3578,Definitely not coincidental 
3579,Cabinets are sooooo essential lmao. Where do I put all the essential food!?😂😂

3836,This is what happens when the cops swore an oath to protect these people and then they get murdered. This is that anger coming out. They burned an entire police precinct. Shits about to go down over there

3854,one of the cops has a sister that is actually the murderer’s wife - just something I learned 
3855,"For Alo. A fun little law fact: third degree murder is defined in the laws of only three state’s Pennsylvania, Florida and Minnesota "
3856,"WAIT I LEARNED THAT ON MY THIRD LAW CLASS!!! Im having so much fun with these, you gotta send me those books you were talking about sometime "
3857,"Loved “For Alo. A fun little law fact: third degree murder is defined in the laws of only three state’s Pennsylvania, Florida and Minnesota ”"
3858,Third degree murder is similar to negligent homicide/manslaughter in other states 
3859,They’re massive and boring LOL u don’t wanna read them 
3860,It’s just called third degree murder there
3861,It just depends on what the state calls it
3862,Or defines it
3863,I remember learning about that in my criminal justice class
3864,"Like here in Cali first degree murder includes the use of gas, FMJ bullets, etc if you kill someone with them "
3865,But i think those are not in any other states laws
3866,The mayor of min was smart to act fast and arrest that dude 
3867,I guess it’s just more specific in California 
3868,Like first degree means premeditation 
3869,You plan to use gas or FMJ bullets 
3870,It’s just different definitions. Whatever the states decide they want that law to be defined as
3871,Ooo I just read Derek was charged with third degree 
3872,"Like if you did that here in nj they’d say wait you used gas, you had to think about using gas before so it’s first degree"
3873,shouldnt he be charged with first degree? 
3874,"wait im getting all of these messages late, whoops "
3875,They formally charged him with third degree. Typically what attorneys do is slap a load of charges and only a few will stick. What he did fits Minnesota’s definition of third degree so I’m pretty sure he’s gonna get convicted
3876,Interestingly his attorney is the same one that acquitted several other killer cops so it’ll be interesting
3877,"oh man, im interested to see where it goes then "
3878,apparently the cop knew George as well and were coworkers for sometime 
3879,some time*
3880,I’m gonna try to watch the case if they broadcast it. This one gonna be interesting 
3881,"The thing is while he COULD be guilty of second/first, a lot of problems with these police brutality cases is that the five the wrong charge"
3882,same I wanna watch it too
3883,Cause if they charge him with first degree they need to prove premeditation/intent to kill. If they don’t prove that he walks free
3884,They’re going the easy route
3885,Proving second or first is not gonna work
3886,"The problem is that a lot of people want them to charge him with first degree murder, but if they do that I don’t think it’ll stick "
3887,That’s law. Do what u can to put the man in jail 
3888,theres info we just dont have or dont know that go agaisnt first degree atm 
3889,I think they could get him on second degree but definitely not first 
3890,Emphasized “theres info we just dont have or dont know that go agaisnt first degree atm ”
3891,"Like yeah he’s definitely guilty of third. He may be guilty of second. Probably not guilty of first. If they charge him with first and he gets off they can’t charge him for second or third because you can’t be tried for the same crime twice, so it’s safer to take less risk "
3892,First they gotta do a deposition and they’re gonna throw everything they can at each other and then we’ll see where the prosecution team takes it
3893,He can’t be charged with second or first
3894,In criminal you can’t find higher 
3895,"people are pushing for first degree only because of the web of connections between the murderer and victim, the anger caused by it has a lot to do with it as well but if you want to go safe, you’re going to have to push and settle for third degree till the story unfolds some more"
3896,Well he can’t actually find higher degrees
3897,If they charged him with second with lesser included offense third degree
3898,But since they charged him with the “bottom tier” of murder they can’t reach up for second 
3899,apparently the cop shot and also killed another person before and I wonder how those trials went
3900,nvm his background info on those cases are closed and un disciplined
3901,"Good lord. Another thing too, the prosecution team can’t do shit about, he got restrained for resisting but the fucking crime they were called for was forging in progress like find me that crime in a book somewhere 😂😂"
3902,"Emphasized “Good lord. Another thing too, the prosecution team can’t do shit about, he got restrained for resisting but the fucking crime they were called for was forging in progress like find me that crime in a book somewhere 😂😂”"

3910,"honestly even with resisting arrest it’s still not an excuse to kill someone. Yeah I get that people can be annoying and fight and stuff, but as soon as they are handcuffed that should be all over honestly no crime is an excuse to kill someone, even if this guy murdered someone he shouldn’t be killed by the police like we don’t want cops to be vigilantes "
3911,That’s what the courts are for 
3912,"The unfortunate truth with these black murders, is that most start with “resisting arrest” when they either were not, or the cops use it as an excuse to do what they do "
3913,It’s fucked
3914,"Yes, it’s not an excuse at all but I’m saying this time is different because everything was recorded and they don’t have that excuse"
3915,"Emphasized “Yes, it’s not an excuse at all but I’m saying this time is different because everything was recorded and they don’t have that excuse”"

3959,Welcome to the private sector buddy 😂😂
3960,Lmao the private sector is good in terms of pay and stuff but the public sector has better benefits and job security so as a young adult higher pay is more important to me
3961,Emphasized “Lmao the private sector is good in terms of pay and stuff but the public sector has better benefits and job security so as a young adult higher pay is more important to me”
3962,"learning programming rn, tell him I said wassuh"
3963,"You ain’t no daddy with a fam, you need the best benefits rn "
3964,That’s what I mean
3965,Like the courts job is great because it’s something to fall back on if I don’t get a job anywhere else 
3966,But damn 85k😍
3967,Instead of 64
3968,Keep in mind someone making 50k can have more money in their bank account thank someone making 85k. My personal belief is that if the pay was slightly closer I’m spread I’d take the benefits over higher pay but that’s a decent increase in cash right there so idk 
3969,"I was looking into it and if I wanted healthcare with the courts, it’s an additional 10k taken out just for me"
3970,Also starting pay vs 5 years into the company where you are and what promotions/bonuses you’ve gotten at that point
3971,Which is eh because my whole fam pays $13k for ours 
3972,Well keep in mind ur parents have been around longer 
3973,And I need healthcare lol especially with all my preexisting conditions
3974,Do some research into benefits
3975,Cuz u may be earning less cash but u got job security and other things. TRADE OFFS OF THE JOB MARKET 
3976,Honestly what I planned on doing was living like I’m making like 65% of what I’m making and saving the rest 
3977,At least 25% of you salary should ALWAYS go into your savings
3978,As you should 
3979,I’m gonna graduate with like 70k in loans well maybe more if my parents end up kicking me out then I’ll have to pay for my rent but I wanna get that paid off ASAP 
3980,Be careful not to overpay. Find the right balance. Obviously u wanna pay it off as fast as possible but make sure u can afford the payments. Then just refinance down the road
3981,"Yeah that’s true, I wanna do as much as I can while still building up savings "

5219,to be fair harvard gives out more financial aid than any other school lol 
5220,Yeah But other schools are going to use that as a benchmark and the rest of us are going to get screwed
5221,i’m pretty sure i saw somewhere that 70% of harvard students have a full ride or some crazy number like that 
5222,yeah no that’s true
5223,Harvard has no reason charging 50k when their endowment is 2B $
5224,we’re paying full price for a worse off education experience 
5225,so with every other school it makes sense but harvard the only people paying full tuition are the people who’s families can actually truly afford it 
5226,if they did that for us then it’d be bullshit of course 
5227,like i’m pretty sure i saw that the average student there only pays like $12k 
5228,even tho the tuition is $50k 
5229,and it’s incredibly rare that people don’t get any financial aid unless they’re like rich af 
5230,That school got too much money
5231,Only reason they give that much aid is cuz they can afford it
5232,thats fucked wth

6737,"i’d really rather we ban the practices that they’re using and then ban any app that doesn’t follow them, rather than just a single app because it creates a dangerous precedent "
6738,and if they stop using those practices they can be unbanned

9019,Fun fact! Have you ever wondered where the default death animation from Among Us came from? It was actually from John Carpenter’s and early ideas and concepts for his movie “THE THING” where the parasite turned the imposter’s body into a parasitical mouth! Most of the early designs and inspirations for Among Us come from The Thing and Ridley Scott’s ALIEN from 1979

9269,weed will be legal for medical dispensaries to sell right after the election 
9270,meaning if the ballot measure passes we can go to nj to buy weed next week
9271,Wait without a medical card next week? I thought it’s starting in 2021
9272,Yea when ballots pass I think they go into effect the next year
9273,Aka January 1st you can go
9274,Oh wait ur talkin bout the state senator who said that. But the head of med weed in NJ was like yea that’s not happening 
9275,ahhhh okay 
9276,yeah that’s what i was reading
9277,Makes sense he rejected that idea. Actual med users won’t be able to get anything
9278,it’s still exciting though 
9279,polls are basically saying that it has a 90+% chance to pass 
9280,It’s definitely passing
9281,And when it does PA gonna have pressure to legalize 
9282,exactly

9288,"that would be so fun, im so down :) "
9289,the election this week is gonna be wild
9290,wanna know a fun fact about computers and numbers and stuff
9291,in the real world almost nothing is stored as a float/double/decimal
9292,it’s usually a separate integer before and after the decimal point 
9293,That’s stupid. Why
9294,?
9295,"because it is impossible to store values between numbers using binary, so oftentimes it’s just an estimate. like if you have 0.5, in the computer it’s really 0.50000000000001 or something like that "
9296,"which wouldn’t be an issue with small values, but over time with a lot of calculations the number could start to drift a lot from the real value "
9297,Oh wow. That makes sense now. Thank you lol
9298,"it’s cause you can only store decimals that are direct fractions of 2, like 1/2, 1/4, 1/8 etc. so for example 3/4 is actually stored as 1/2+1/4 "
9299,"but most decimals aren’t even values of powers of 2, so they add up a whole bunch of those values to get as close as possible "
9300,so my example was bad 0.5 is actually stored as 0.5 lol 
9301,Oh no not trump supporters blocking a highway in NJ after saying that was a capital offense to BLM protesters 🤪🤪

9387,Well the racists do like to vote in person 
9388,I hope all the places that decriminalized take the people in jail for that out
9389,it definitely isn’t zero it’s just that mail in was mostly democrat so the graph didn’t change much i guess 
9390,So they get counted first 
9391,also the republican line should be more to the right as well 
9392,because it’s supposed to be a function of time

9558,That might be the most stupid thing ever… lets close all the business but keep the kids in school as if that makes sense..
9559,France did that and it backfired completely
9560,Obviously different countries but the whole keeping the children in school thing did not work. They also don’t really have an online learning structure but still 
9561,Lol remember when it was two weeks to stop the spread.. that aged well
9562,We probably gonna go on a nationwide lockdown next year for like 4 weeks
9563,didnt Biden confirm that already
9564,schools are already online in philly
9565,they have been for a few weeks
9566,but the nation wide lockdown pt 2 is happening early 2021 already isnt it 
9567,Well nothing from him is “confirmed” until he’s actually in office 
9568,But yea we’re prolly locking down cause this shit is getting out of hand
9569,China virus lookin like the America virus now

9572,my aunt said that over half of the nurses at her hospital have quit because of people who aren’t taking this seriously 
9573,"she said a few weeks ago that normally there are 3-4 nurses per patient group, and now there is one nurse for 2 patient groups "
9574,"Hospitals aren’t being over run, my sister and sisterinlaw both work in covid units and they aren’t filling up like they said"
9575,My sister-in-law works at Penn Hosptial in philly
9576,Im sure boncha people are quoting because they aren’t getting paid anymore
9577,my aunt works in new brunswick nj 
9578,it’s been getting bad lately just because everyone decided to forget about covid and celebrate biden’s win in the city but thats the only added spike that’s “local” to us
9579,she was forced to move from the nicu to the regular icu or be fired 
9580,It might be a little different in NJ but I cant imagine too crazy
9581,I mean some states are still worse than others
9582,Dang yeah they were cutting hours of nurses because they weren’t able to keep their same pay
9583,Removed an exclamation from “Im sure boncha people are quoting because they aren’t getting paid anymore”

9585,Most red or southern states are getting fucked rn 
9586,San Diego county is back on lockdown too 
9587,that was also a few weeks ago it could be changing now
9588,If it is changing it’s changing for the worse
9589,Most blue cities are getting fucked as well
9590,how so
9591,literally everywhere is fucked rn 
9592,there is almost nowhere that isn’t 
9593,This whole country is getting dicked down by the rona
9594,Hopefully this moderna or Pfizer vaccine are as good as they say 
9595,We likely won’t see it distributed to us till like summer 
9596,Sorry im an antivaxer
9597,But the good ol US of A set a new record today for number of hospitalizations thanks to rona
9598,Jk jk
9599,Laughed at “Sorry im an antivaxer”
9600,I believe in EsSenTiaL oILs
9601,Facts that shit saves lives
9602,i saw in el paso they have like double the amount of dead bodies than they have room in their morgues 
9603,my chackra >> vaccines
9604,Bro lil bit of oils mixed in with the cereal you are Rona free
9605,Emphasized “i saw in el paso they have like double the amount of dead bodies than they have room in their morgues ”
9606,so they had to order to-go morgues 
9607,dish detergent in my sandwich to clean my insides ✨ 
9608,"If the trend continues and vaccines are not disprutibted soon, Rona will be the leading cause of death in the US "
9609,"@ Jake, its also because it cant be fully staffed so they cant work the bodies as fast"
9610,Ignore that distributed word I had a seizure

9615,i hope the vaccine can get distributed fast 
9616,fax 
9617,📠 
9618,luckily there are two different kinds and if they both get approved we will be able to get one of them faster
9619,Modernas can because of the storage conditions 
9620,Pfizer’s cannot
9621,yes i know i saw that
9622,Emphasized “Modernas can because of the storage conditions ”
9623,it doesn’t even matter though they’re both about the same effectiveness so if they’re both safe i don’t care at all which one i can get my hands on 
9624,Creepy stat: if 95% of Americans wore masks consistently 68kcloves could be saved by March 1st
9625,"If not, death toll predicted to reach 439,000 by March 1"
9626,Well of course but if Pfizer can’t even distribute the thing then u cant get it
9627,thats a crazy number
9628,that’s the reason a true lockdown would actually work 
9629,Yea but Americans don’t listen 
9630,there was never a real lockdown earlier this year 
9631,like if everyone truly locked down we would be over this in a few weeks 
9632,but we can’t do that without giving stimulus to people 
9633,The problem unfortunately is deeper cuz you could make a lockdown but if 30% of America believes this virus is a joke or not real then we are not gonna get better anytime soon 
9634,It’s a joke tbh and sad but 
9635,Emphasized “but we can’t do that without giving stimulus to people ”
9636,yeah it’s very unfortunate 
9637,at least we have each other :) am i rite 
9638,it really hit me when kyle’s dad passed away from it back in april 
9639,Emphasized “at least we have each other :) am i rite ”
9640,You know whats also a really fucked up stat.. there is almost as many rona deaths this year as abortions in America
9641,I didnt know that
9642,i’m all for killing babies but i hate the thought of giving a woman the right to do what she wants with her body 
9643,An even bigger fucked up stat is how many of those kids that didn’t get aborted end up dead or homes less or mentally ill 👀
9644,📠
9645,Emphasized “An even bigger fucked up stat is how many of those kids that didn’t get aborted end up dead or homes less or mentally ill 👀”
9646,I won’t get into it right now about that lol it needs to be in person so things dont get construed
9647,Well that issue needs to be fixed first before the issue of abortion even begins
9648,How u gonna be pro life but the second the baby is born no one cares no more
9649,Then the next step is legalizing coat hangers 😈
9650,Because there are plenty of kids that that doesn’t happen to as well.. you cant say how a life would end up

10285,Loved “i also like the emoji idea!!! ”
10286,"Loved “I say that because if you’re going to big companies/governments, drawing a new website and how it should look is nice, but isn’t worth anything because they still have to build it out, and like Jake said, that is the difficult part of it. The actual code. Where as if you put together emoji’s or logo’s its a lot easier to sell”"
10287,"Loved “I really like the emoji idea, and if your looking to do logos or rebranding experience, look to small business in the Philly area. You’ll have a lot more luck with that stuff than big corporations”"

10722,So maybe email a QR code out to employees? How would those without access to a laptop scan it? 
10723,"Well if they don’t have a laptop that’s a bigger issue because all of your solutions you said before require laptops. However QR code’s can also be printed out and on paper. So, if you send a letter of intent to one of your clients, you could stick it with that"
10724,Well we could text files to employees but QR definitely easier for employees

11624,there’s no rule saying she has to resign up until the inauguration so maybe she’s doing that

11626,"Yeah that would have been today, when they are sworn back into office. Idk I thought it was just strange"
11627,maybe cause there’s a lot going on rn and she still wants her vote to be counted? idk how senate replacements work in california so maybe she’s trying to hold off as long as possible cause of that

12713,@people that can’t place orders rn

12717,Robinhood getting sued up the ass tho just wait
12718,Straight up illegal what they did 
12719,it’s not like there’s any insider trading cause it’s all available to the public

12725,Because they did LOL
12726,because if that’s the case then rich people who short stocks and tell people they are shorting stocks should go to prison too then 
12727,No jail is gonna happen but hedge funds will find some way to bankrupt traders
12728,AKA freezing buying so everyone opens sell orders driving the price down
